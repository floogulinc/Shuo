(Chinese for "to speak")

__What is it?__
Shuo is a web IRC client that you host on your own server. This is PonyChat's 
fork of [Shout](https://github.com/erming/shout), forked due to Shout appearing 
to be stagnant.

__What features does it have?__
- Multiple user support
- Stays connected even when you close the browser
- Connect from multiple devices at once
- Responsive layout â€” works well on your smartphone
- Theme support
- Unread message marker
- _.. and more!_

## Install

```
sudo npm install -g shuo
```

## Usage

When the install is complete, go ahead and run this in your terminal:

```
shuo --help
```

For more information, read the [documentation](https://github.com/PonyChat/Shuo/wiki).

## Development setup

To run the app from source, just clone the code and run this in your terminal:

```
npm install
grunt
./index.js --port 8080
```

And if you don't have [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) installed 
already, just run `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
